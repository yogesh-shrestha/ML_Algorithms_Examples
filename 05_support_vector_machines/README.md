## Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine is a versatile Machine Learning Model capable of performing linear or non-linear classification, regression.

The idea behind the support vector machine is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional Space that distinctly separates the classes. There are many possible hyperplanes, to separate the data points of the classes. But the objective of this algorithm is to find the hyperplane with maximum margin. Suport vectors are the data points that like on the hyperplane.



First of all, we suppose that input data points belongs to one of two classes $$y_i \in \{ -1, 1 \}$$
